BitTorrent is a protocol for downloading and distributing files across the Internet.
In contrast with the traditional client/server relationship, in which downloaders connect to the
central server, participants in the BitTorrent network, called peers, download pieces of files from
each other - this is what makes it a peer-to-peer protocol.
